Rebalance is a non-destructive operation that will find metrics that
are on the wrong server or that have duplicates and will near-atomically
move them to the correct server and backfill as needed.

You may optionally specify the network locations of other Buckyd daemons
as arguments to this command.  Metrics found via these daemons will be
relocated according to the hash ring.  This is useful for moving all
metrics off of a server when removing it from the cluster.  Metrics will be
deleted per normal according to the --no-delete flag.

Use -s to operate on metrics found on the initial host given by -h or the
BUCKYHOST environment variable.  Cluster health is not checked.  Moves that
result in metrics that live on a different host will be completed, so other
hosts will be affected even with -s.

Use --no-delete to leave the old metrics in place.  The default is to
remove metrics from their old location after they have been moved and
backfilled to the new location.

The --no-op option will not alter any metrics and print a report of what
would have been done.

Set -w to change the number of worker threads used to upload the Whisper
DBs to the remote servers.`
